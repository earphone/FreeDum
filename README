			color

Nov 29, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Created compareFriend button in monthActivity menu
	Added compareFriend method in monthActivity
		Prompts user to select a friend and then relaunches month with
		friend as EXTRA_MESSAGE so that CalendarAdapter can be created
		with multiple users.

Nov 25, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Finished dialog for adding and checking for friend
		Only implemented in monthActivity
		Inefficient due to multiple query calls upon saving

Nov 24, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
    Friend:
	Added Dialog for adding a friend in monthActivity

    Aestheti:
	Added time value to username_month_day_year so that they can be sorted 
		by time when queried
	Fixed bug for repeated events
	Added row view for times below event
	Increasd size of times

Nov 14, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Optimized the calls to Parse when creating the calendar

			Parse each time
	Changed the new event sign from "+" to "FreeDUM"
	Changed the title in new event to "New FreeDUM"
	

Nov 12, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Reworked month view to have a list view below
		Shows all events on current selected day
		Syncs with major holidays
		Slow since calls Parse everytime a day is selected
	Changed background for login
	Sign-up textboxes are no longer clear

Nov 08, 2013:  Brenden Takai
	Fixed scrunching when keyboard pops up.
	Still trying to get list activity to work.

Nov 08, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Implemented a calendar view in the MonthActivity
	Clicking on a day will launch NewEventActivity with selected day
	Added left and right arrows to res/drawable-hdpi
		Arrows don't do anything visually yet

Nov 07, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Removed the button from month and list activites and moved them to the
		actionbar
	Temporarily removed the background from NewEventActivity due to unknown
		cause of OutOfMemoryException that crashes app
	Changed the place where data is saved
		Now saves in public classes username_month_year and
			username_month_day_year 
		Currently puts multiple copies of the same day in
			username_month_year
			Working on finding a fix that checks before updating

Nov 06, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Fixed Layout sizes so they are now 2048 or less
	Save button now saves new events
		Month__Year contains all days events occur on for reference
		Month_Day_Year contains all events on that day
		Data for an event is saved in a JSONObject with the fields:
			name
			fromDate
			toDate
			fromTime
			toTime
	Added initialize Parse to MonthActivity in case they did not close the
		app before

Nov 03, 2013:   Brenden Takai
	Uploaded Revised Layouts.
		Working on ListActivity.

Oct 29, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Removed ALL Time and Date Picker Fragments to save space.
		Moved and modified methods so they all work inside of
		NewEventActivity. Appropriate changes were made to XML as well.
		Picking a date or time now shows the selected time.

Oct 27, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Split Time and Date picker fragment files into From and To Date and Time		Fragments to allow for individual setting of each.
	On creation of NewEventActivity, inputs current time and date in fields.
		

Oct 17, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Added backgrounds created by Brenden for all layouts except login.
	Changed backgrounds for help text and cancel and save buttons to
		compensate for the opacity by default.

Oct 16, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Added Date and Time picker fragment files
	Created and implemented a temporary layout for the new event activity.
		Cancel button closes and sends user back to last view
		Followed similar layout and style of default holo theme calendar
		Clicking on the Date or Time launches Date and Time pickers
		respectively. Setting them is not implemented yet.
		Also, Save button is not implemented.
	In New Event activity added method for showing time and date pickers 
	Side Note:	Considering moving new event and view buttons in List
		and Month activities into the action bar so the views can be
		full screen.

Oct 4, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Linked the main buttons in the Month and List Activities
		Launching Month from List or List from Month closes the
		previous Activity. Therefore, pressing the back button closes
		the application.
		Launching NewEvent from List or Month keeps the previous
		Activity open. Therefore, pressing the back button is the same
		as canceling creating a new event.
	Added a logout button in the Action-bar of Month and List Activities
		Sends user to login page

Oct 1, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Created activities for the following:
		List
		Login
		Month
		New Event
		Sign Up
	If there were any layouts already created for the aforementioned
		activities in FreeDum/layout, they were moved into 
		FreeDum/res/layout and renamed to reflect the created activity.
	Used basic template from https://github.com/earphone/AndroidTest/App/
		blob/master/res/layout/login.xml for layout of login:
		FreeDum/res/layout/activity_login.xml
	Imported Parse-1.3.5 into FreeDum/libs
	Set up initializtion of Parse in LoginActivity
	Set LogingActivity as launcher activity
	Implemented Parse login and sign up in LoginActivity and SignUpActivity
		but currently signup does not check for empty fields and lets
		them through.

Sept 22, 2013: 	Brenden Takai
	Updated Layouts - Added day, list, month view layouts.

July 06, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Initial app creation and git setup.
