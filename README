	Uploaded Revised Layouts.
		Working on ListActivity.

Oct 29, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Removed ALL Time and Date Picker Fragments to save space.
		Moved and modified methods so they all work inside of
		NewEventActivity. Appropriate changes were made to XML as well.
		Picking a date or time now shows the selected time.

Oct 27, 2013:	Brandon Higashi

Oct 17, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Added backgrounds created by Brenden for all layouts except login.

		compensate for the opacity by default.

Oct 16, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Added Date and Time picker fragment files
	Created and implemented a temporary layout for the new event activity.
		Cancel button closes and sends user back to last view
		Followed similar layout and style of default holo theme calendar
		Clicking on the Date or Time launches Date and Time pickers
		respectively. Setting them is not implemented yet.
		Also, Save button is not implemented.
	In New Event activity added method for showing time and date pickers 
	Side Note:	Considering moving new event and view buttons in List
		and Month activities into the action bar so the views can be
		full screen.

Oct 4, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Linked the main buttons in the Month and List Activities
		Launching Month from List or List from Month closes the
		previous Activity. Therefore, pressing the back button closes
		the application.
		Launching NewEvent from List or Month keeps the previous
		Activity open. Therefore, pressing the back button is the same
		as canceling creating a new event.
	Added a logout button in the Action-bar of Month and List Activities
		Sends user to login page

Oct 1, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
	Created activities for the following:
		List
		Login
		Month
		New Event
		Sign Up
	If there were any layouts already created for the aforementioned
		activities in FreeDum/layout, they were moved into 
		FreeDum/res/layout and renamed to reflect the created activity.
	Used basic template from https://github.com/earphone/AndroidTest/App/
		blob/master/res/layout/login.xml for layout of login:
		FreeDum/res/layout/activity_login.xml
	Imported Parse-1.3.5 into FreeDum/libs
	Set up initializtion of Parse in LoginActivity
	Set LogingActivity as launcher activity
	Implemented Parse login and sign up in LoginActivity and SignUpActivity
		but currently signup does not check for empty fields and lets
		them through.

July 06, 2013:	Brandon Higashi
